Begin by setting up an app on Streamlit that includes a map displaying various stakes within imaginary boundaries. Define these boundaries within the app.

Once the map with the stakes is ready, generate an embedded link for that specific map.

Paste the obtained embedded link into your code where necessary to incorporate the map into the app's functionality.

Run the code within a collaborative notebook to create the app file.

Upload the generated app file to your GitHub repository for storage and version control.

Establish a connection between Streamlit and GitHub to enable seamless deployment of the app directly from the repository.

below is  the deployed app link, allowing others to access and interact with the application.
